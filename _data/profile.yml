  <p> <strong>ðŸ‘‹Hi, welcome to my page!</strong>
  <p>
    I am an M.Phil. student in Data Science and Analytics, under the supervision of <a href="https://luoyuyu.vip/">Prof. Yuyu LUO</a>, at the <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="https://www.cqu.edu.cn/">Chongqing University</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I also spent one year at the <a href="https://www.nusricq.cn/">NUS Chongqing Research Institute</a> advised by <a href="https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elelyc/">Prof. Yung Chii LIANG</a>, for a collaborative educational project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, my primary research focus is on AI for data analytics, with the goal of democratizing data science. I am particularly interested in natural language to SQL and automatic data analysis. As a beginner, I welcome any opportunities for communication and collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me!
