  <p> <strong>ðŸ‘‹Hi, welcome to my page!</strong>
  <p>
    I am an M.Phil. student in Data Science and Analytics, under the supervision of <a href="https://luoyuyu.vip/">Prof. Yuyu LUO</a>, at the <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="https://www.cqu.edu.cn/">Chongqing University</a>. 
    My current research focuses on AI for data analytics, with the aim of democratizing data science. I am particularly interested in Natural Language to SQL and Automated Data Analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a beginner, I'm open to opportunities for communication and collaboration. Feel free to reach out!
